# 2019

This repo is a collection of scripts and utilities that I used to create my [2019 "Year in Review" post](https://2019.bwong.net)

## Language Choice

Python isn't my primary language (Go & Ruby would have been faster!). My main server language at work is Python/Django, so this year, I thought I'd use Python to see how to build a Python project from scratch.

If you have any suggestions for improvements, I'd love to hear them! Feel free to email me or open a Github issue :)
