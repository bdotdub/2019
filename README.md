# 2019

This repo is a collection of scripts and utilities that I used to create my [2019 "Year in Review" post](https://posts.bwong.net/posts/2019-year-in-review/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=year_in_review)

## Language Choice

Python isn't my primary language (Go & Ruby would have been faster!). My main server language at work is Python/Django, so this year, I thought I'd use Python to see how to build a Python project from scratch.

NOTE: code quality is quick and **really** hacky just to get the data I need. Not reflective of "real" code ;)

## Project Structure

* `config` – where all the config files go. In our case, we need things like Google API client credentials. It also stores some credentials.
* `youtube` – Youtube watch history parsing & output
* `photos` – utilities to pull API data from [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com)
* `swarm` – TBD
